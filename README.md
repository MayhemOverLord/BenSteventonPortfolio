# BenSteventonPortfolio
A portfolio for Ben Steventon

Thank you for browsing through my portfolio, this consists of various projects that I have produced during my education and free time outside of university.


About Myself:

I am a determined and hardworking Computer Science and AI graduate from the University of Sussex. I have a history of strong written and verbal communication skills. I have a positive attitude towards learning and a desire to improve my skills and abilities. I enjoy working in teams but can also work as a self starter, endeavouring to accomplish all my goals once I begin.

I aspire to dive deep into a career in software development, furthering the knowledge that I have gained from my university degree. The degree pushed me to improve my way of thinking and build a set of usable skills while also challenging myself, a challenge which I overcame and achieved a first class degree with honours,

I am excited by the opportunity to be able to advance my skillset and gain valuable experience in the field of Computer Science.


Final Year Project:

My final Year Project at the University of Sussex was a 2-dimensional top down dungeon exploration game, this project resulted in my achievement of a first class degree with honours.
